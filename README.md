# Don't Kill the Lancenger

You are a lancenger, a skilled courier of the land of infinite desert--not
dessert, mind you! Itâ€™s very difficult to find the ingredients for cake here in
the desert land. Ahem. Your job is to deliver packages in exchange for
cash--cash in exchange for packages. Equipped with fuel, your trusty lance, and
the need for speed, advance your settlement into the New Sand Era by sheer wit
and grit alone--and your intimate knowledge of the modern economic sandscape.
Come and have the experience of a lancetime--err, lifetime.
